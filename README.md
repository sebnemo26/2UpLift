# 2UpLift

## Project Description

INTRODUCTION

Previously, the most common neurological standpoint defended a fixed state: the human brain was thought of as a machine, set in stone, unable to evolve and simply persecuting code. Whereas several scientific breakthroughs, well summarised by the MIT press knowledge series, demonstrated the existence of neuroplasticity: the idea that the human brain was much more flexible and open to manipulation, for the better or for the worse depending on how we take advantage of this property, and neuronal connections could change even within moments. While this helped develop various self-help ideologies and promote positivity among humans, it's initial boon is much more significant: treatment. Many illnesses, both mental and phsiological, were proven to be curable to a large degree simply with the help of neuroplastic intervention.

AIM

The aim of 2UpLift is to make use of various "games" that were specifically designed for the aforementioned neuroplastic development in order to help people (primarily children and teenagers) with speech impediments, autism spectrum disorder, reflex and coordination issues, attention disorders, and learning disabilities. By engaging them in platform game-like levels, we hope to be able to trigger neural development.

Our biggest goal is making neuroplastic treatment more accessible and available at home! While these games aren't intended to replace classical healthcare, they do pose an alternative by being free resources for development and treatment at home. Indeed, our hope is 2 lift children with learning disabilities up!

FURTHER EXPLANATION

Of course, change doesn't happen immediately. Similar learning interfaces, such as Merzenich's FastForWord (now slightly outdated but proved to be very effective), have been tested across the globe with long practice hours and repeating the behaviour for months in order to witness palpable difference. This is because it takes time for the brain to rearrange itself and for it to see it neccessary to do so. We propose 25 games, most of them developed by university professors and experts of the field, then adjusted for better integration with infants by me- a very enthusiastic teenager who has been educating herself on the principles of neuroscience for the past six years. Our goal is to make real difference within 3 to 6 months with approximately two hours of specialised games per day; though the result will change greatly depending on the specific patient.

GAMES





CONCLUSION

There are various neurological issues that exist in our world. While for most of our history, brains were regarded as fixed machines. Whereas principles of neuroplasticity show that we have a much larger opportunity at hand; for improvement and healing. My project, 2UpLift, has various games supported by neurophysiological research in order to help the process of recovery for teens and children with speech impediments, reflexive drawbacks, learning disabilities, and more. Each "game" has various levels, that have the potential to make great advancements after 3-6 months of regular practice. I hope it helps and you enjoy!
